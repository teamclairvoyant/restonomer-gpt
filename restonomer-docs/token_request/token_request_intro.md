# What is token request ?

The authentication mechanism in restonomer also gives the user a provision to configure the token request.

There are certain scenarios where you are required to provide the authentication credentials for the main data request
from the token value generated by some other token request.

Keeping that in mind, user can configure the token request and then can use the token response in the main data request.

User can configure whether the token needs to be fetched from token response body or token response headers.

The `token-response-placeholder` config in `token-request` can be initialised with below 2 values:
* `ResponseBody`
* `ResponseHeaders`

**_If the token is to be fetched from the token response body, it is assumed that the token request will always generate
the token response in a json format that will contain the attribute required by the main data request._**
